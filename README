DESCRIPTION:

An instant, cross-platform, web-based, screen recording Java applet for posting user-created screencasts
to a server. The applet acts as a standard interface for recording, cropping, and posting while an 
OS-specific command-line tool is fired up under the covers as a process to create a high-fps screen recording 
of the user's screen and handle any post-processing needs.  For Linux, this tool is a standard build of FFMPEG.
For Windows, a custom build of FFMPEG based on discussion on the FFMPEG developer mailing list. For Mac, a
custom built screen recording Objective-C app based on the QTKit of Snow Leopard.

This tool was inspired by websites like www.screencast-o-matic.com and www.screentoaster.com whose
approaches include all sorts of technologies, including FFMPEG, VNC, and JNI.
