DESCRIPTION:

An instant, cross-platform, web-based, screen recording Java applet for posting user-created screencasts
to a server. The applet acts as a standard interface for recording, cropping, and posting while an 
OS-specific command-line tool is fired up under the covers as a process to create a high-fps screen recording 
of the user's screen and handle any post-processing needs.  For Linux, this tool is a standard build of FFMPEG.
For Windows, a custom build of FFMPEG based on discussion on the FFMPEG developer mailing list. For Mac, a
custom built screen recording Objective-C app based on the QTKit of Snow Leopard.

This tool was inspired by websites like www.screencast-o-matic.com and www.screentoaster.com whose
approaches include all sorts of technologies, including FFMPEG, VNC, and JNI.

========================================

REQUIREMENTS:

Developer:
	JRE 1.6
	Eclipse (recommended)
	Ant (recommended)
	Access to Mac, Windows, and Linux environments for testing and compilation
	Ability to sign a JAR file

Client-side:
	JRE 1.6
	
Server-side:
	Ability to serve a signed Java applet
	Ability to receive a POST with a multi-part file	

========================================

SETUP USING ECLIPSE:

1) Checkout the code:
	git clone http://github.com/onedanshow/Screen-Courter.git
	
2) Import the project folder into an Eclipse workspace

3) In Eclipse, open the Run > Run Configurations window and follow these sub-steps:
	-For the Main tab, select "Screen-Courter" as the project and "com.reelfx.Applet" as the Applet
	-For the Parameters tab, set or add the following:
		width: 770
		height: 70
		post_url: (url to post the screen recording video file to)
		screen_capture_name: (name for the screen to show in the interface; ex: "Test Screen Capture")
		dev_mode: true (used only when running from Eclipse for debugging purposes and to work with the cropping interface when developing on Mac)
	-For the JRE tab, make sure you're using Java 1.6
	-Press "Apply" and then close the Run Configurations window

4) Copy and rename config-example.properties to config.properties and configure it accordingly.  This file will not go in source control.

5) Run the Applet.

========================================

TEST DEPLOYMENT:

1) Copy and rename build-example.properties to build.properties and configure it accordingly. This file will not go in source control. 
Some properties are the same as those in the Parameters tab above. It is assumed that you already have generated a certificate in your local keystore. 

2) Using Ant, run the create_test_page action.

3) Open the test page in a browser.

========================================

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:

1) Copy and rename build-example.properties to build.properties and configure it accordingly. This file will not go in source control. 
It is assumed that you already have generated a certificate in your local keystore. 

2) Using Ant, run the create_production_jar# action.

3) Embed the applet.jar in the appropriate page of your website, using the template.html and/or test page as a guide.

========================================

BUILDING OS-SPECIFIC BINARIES FOR SCREEN RECORDING:

The binaries needed for each OS are included with the source code. However the need may arise for your to compile them yourself.

Linux: 

Mac:

Windows:
